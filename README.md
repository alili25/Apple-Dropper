## Summary
For this project, I created a simplified, non-violent version of the Atari game Kaboom! using Unity. In Apple Dropper, a tree moves left and right at the top of the screen and drops apples. The player controls three baskets at the bottom of the screen using their mouse. The goal is to try to catch as many apples as possible. Missing an apple removes a basket, and the game ends when all baskets are gone. I used this video for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NttMqA1H2ZM


## Additional Features Added 
- Added a score counter that increases each time the player catches an apple.
- Implemented high scores to save the highest score.
- Made the game progressively more difficult by decreasing the apple spawn delay over time.
